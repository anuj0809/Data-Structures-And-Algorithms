## Search Algorithms

### [Linear]


From linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
  Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n)
* Best case performance	O(1)
* Average case performance	O(n)
* Worst case space complexity	O(1) iterative

### [Binary]


From  Binary search, also known as half-interval search or logarithmic search, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(log n)
* Best case performance	O(1)
* Average case performance	O(log n)
* Worst case space complexity	O(1)
